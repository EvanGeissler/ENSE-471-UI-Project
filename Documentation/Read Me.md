Used for our documentation of the project. 

This is currently split into separate labs for each milestone. (i.e. Milestone 1 has Lab 1.1, Lab 1.2, Lab 1.3).
Will also include the outline for Milestones in here to properly understand what each lab is about. This seems
like it will be the most reliable and informative way to display the information; given directly from Tim.
